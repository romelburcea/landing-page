        <p id="quo">Among other things, you'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and frightened and even sickened by human behavior.

            You'll learn from them—if you want to. Just as someday, if you have something to offer, someone will learn something from you. 
            It's a beautiful reciprocal arrangement. And it isn't education. It's history. It's poetry.”</hp>
